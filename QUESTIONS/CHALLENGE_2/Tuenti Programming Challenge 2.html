<p>Yuki is a lucky girl. Her grandma Chika is a lovely old lady, owner of a sheep farm, expert baker and knitting ninja, and has a hazelnut tree in her backyard. Yuki is always craving the super tasty hazelnuts that can be picked from it and asking for more and more.  But her grandma is a wise woman and she doesn’t want to spoil Yuki or to make her sick with all the hazelnuts she can eat. </p>
<p>Chika is quite a fan of binary numbers and uses base 2 for everything (and I can assure you she has never been cheated when buying groceries). She came up with the following simple game for Yuki: she would say a number N and Yuki would choose two numbers, x and y, such that x + y = N.  Then Chika would give Yuki as many hazelnuts as the sum of the number of ones of x and y in base 2. For example, if Chika chooses 7 and Yuki picks 3 and 4, then she will get 2 (as 3 in base 2 is 11) plus 1 (since 4 in base 2 is 100): 3 hazelnuts. </p>

<p>Yuki wants to know what the maximum number of hazelnuts that she could get from Chika.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, C, and C test cases follow. Each test case consists of a line with an integer N, 0 ≤ N.</p>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: M", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and M is the maximum number of hazelnuts that Yuki can get from her binary grandmother.</p>

<h4>Limits:</h4>
1 ≤ C ≤ 2000 <br>
Test dataset: N ≤ 10<sup>4</sup> <br>
Challenge dataset: N ≤ 10<sup>19</sup> (may not fit in a 32 bit integer)

<h3>Sample input</h3>
<code>
	3 <br>
	1 <br>
	6 <br>
	2135
</code>

<h3>Sample output</h3>

<code>
	Case #1: 1 <br>
	Case #2: 4 <br>
	Case #3: 14
</code>

<h2>Submit &amp; test your code</h2>
<p>To test and submit code we provide a set of tools to help you. Download
<a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/tools">contest tools</a> if you don't have done that already. Then with
the challenge token you will be able to test and submit your solution to this
challenge.</p>
<code>Challenge token: CHALLENGE_2</code>
<br>
<h3>To test your program</h3>
<code>./test_challenge CHALLENGE_2 path/program</code>
<p>A nice output will tell you if your program got the right solution or not. You can try as
many times as you need.</p>
<h3>To submit your program to the challenge</h3>
<code>./submit_challenge CHALLENGE_2 path/source_pkg.tgz path/program</code>
<p>Note that you first need to solve the test phase before submiting the code. On the submit phase we
could give your program harder questions, so try to make your program failsafe.</p>
<p>Remind <b>you can only submit once!</b>. Once your solution is submitted you won't be able to amend it to fix issues or make it faster,
so please be sure your program is finished before submitting it.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts, please check the <a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/help">help section</a>.</p>

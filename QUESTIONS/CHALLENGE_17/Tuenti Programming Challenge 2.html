<br>
<p>Daniel's favourite food is pizza, which he likes to share with his girlfriend, Sara. As she also loves pizza, it is of utmost importance, in order to avoid unnecessary quarrels, to split the pizza into <b>two equally-sized slices</b>. Of course, the pizza contains ingredients such as pepperoni, sausage, pineapple, etc. These <b>ingredients are delicate and cannot be cut*</b>. As you can imagine, both Sara and Daniel <b>must eat the same number of ingredients of each type</b>.</p>

<p>The pizza shop where they order from is not a typical one. They like to decorate their fabulous disks by using shaped ingredients. This spring, it is time for <b>regular polygons</b>!</p>

<p>As you can easily observe, depending on the position, size and shape of the ingredients, it is not always possible to make a straight-line cut into the pizza in such a way that the two slices have the same area and the same number of ingredients of each type. Given a pizza and its ingredients, is there a <b>straight-line</b> cut that makes both Daniel and Sara happy?</p><br>

<p>*An ingredient is cut if it is split in two slices with positive area.</p><br>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, C, and C test cases follow (1 ≤ C ≤ 50). Each test case has the following format.
<code>
C<sub>x</sub> C<sub>y</sub> R <br>
N <br>
ID<sub>i</sub> N<sub>i,e</sub> N<sub>i</sub> <br>
C<sub>ij,x</sub> C<sub>ij,y</sub> V<sub>ij,x</sub> V<sub>ij,y</sub> <br>
</code>
<br>

Where, <br>
<b>(C<sub>x</sub>, C<sub>y</sub>)</b> is the <b>center</b> of the pizza and <b>R</b> its <b>radius</b>. <br>
<b>N</b> is a non-negative integer, 0 ≤ N ≤ 10, that tells how many different types of ingredients the pizza contains. <br>
<b>ID<sub>i</sub></b> is a string which identifies the i-ingredient. <br>
<b>N<sub>i,e</sub></b> is an integer, 3 ≤ N ≤ 7, that indicates <b>how many edges</b> the ingredients of type ID<sub>i</sub> have. <br>
<b>N<sub>i</sub></b> is an integer, 1 ≤ N<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10, that indicates <b>how many ingredients of type ID<sub>i</sub></b> the pizza has. <br>
<b>(C<sub>ij,x</sub> C<sub>ij,y</sub>)</b> is the <b>center of the ingredient</b> ij, 1 ≤ j ≤ N<sub>i</sub> <br>
<b>(V<sub>ij,x</sub> V<sub>ij,y</sub>)</b> is a <b>vertex of the ingredient</b> ij <br>
<br>

</p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: M", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and M is the string "TRUE" or "FALSE" depending on whether the pizza can be cut or not.</p>

<code>Challenge token: CHALLENGE_17</code>
<br>
<h3>To test your program</h3>
<code>./test_challenge CHALLENGE_17 path/program</code>
<p>A nice output will tell you if your program got the right solution or not. You can try as
many times as you need.</p>
<h3>To submit your program to the challenge</h3>
<code>./submit_challenge CHALLENGE_17 path/source_pkg.tgz path/program</code>
<p>Note that you first need to solve the test phase before submiting the code. On the submit phase we
could give your program harder questions, so try to make your program failsafe.</p>
<p>Remind <b>you can only submit once!</b>. Once your solution is submitted you won't be able to amend it to fix issues or make it faster,

You are a genius working for one of the most famous high-frequency trading firms in the world. But you are an evil genius and have found a backdoor that lets you add fake operations in the last second with all the daily stock information available. Having all the information, you can choose when to buy some shares and when to sell them and get maximum profit. Of course, you don't want to be greedy and draw attention to the operations and get caught, so you limit them to one buy and sell per day.
Since it's a high-frequency trading system and you expect a big input, you design a program that reads all the stock information with 100ms resolution, gives the time when you want to add the buy and sell operations (in milliseconds) and tells you the expected gain. Of course, you want the maximum gain for that transaction.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>One line with an integer for each stock sample.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The starting (when you buy) and ending (when you sell) point of the transaction in milliseconds and the expected gain.</p>

<h3>Sample input</h3>
<code>70<br>
93<br>
69<br>
75<br>
52<br>
73<br>
67<br>
81<br>
65<br>
48<br>
67</code>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<code>400 700 29</code>

<h2>Submit &amp; test your code</h2>
<p>To test and submit code we provide a set of tools to help you. Download
<a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/tools">contest tools</a> if you don't have done that already. Then with
the challenge token you will be able to test and submit your solution to this
challenge.</p>
<code>Challenge token: CHALLENGE_3</code>
<br>
<h3>To test your program</h3>
<code>./test_challenge CHALLENGE_3 path/program</code>
<p>A nice output will tell you if your program got the right solution or not. You can try as
many times as you need.</p>
<h3>To submit your program to the challenge</h3>
<code>./submit_challenge CHALLENGE_3 path/source_pkg.tgz path/program</code>
<p>Note that you first need to solve the test phase before submiting the code. On the submit phase we
could give your program harder questions, so try to make your program failsafe.</p>
<p>Remind <b>you can only submit once!</b>. Once your solution is submitted you won't be able to amend it to fix issues or make it faster,
so please be sure your program is finished before submitting it.</p>

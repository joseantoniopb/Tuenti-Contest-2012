<br>
<p>Everyday we need more passwords to access the growing number of services available online.</p>

<p>We usually don't care if they are weak, but some of them are very important, as those used in online banking. For that reason, each bank has thought of a different way to protect their customers and allow secure transactions.</p>

<p>A common method is to ask the user for some random characters from a password. For example, they may ask for the 1st, 3rd, and 5th characters; and if the password is 325467, the correct answer would be: 356.</p>

<p>But is this method really secure? If someone gets the different subcodes, could he recover the full password?</p>

<p>Given that the characters are always asked for in order, and assuming that passwords do not contain repeated characters, your objective is to find all the possible correct passwords.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>One line for each subcode used in a successful transaction. Subcodes contain only alphanumeric characters (0-9, A-Z, a-z).</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The shortest valid password(s). If there is more than one possible password, output all of them (one per line) in alphabetical order.</p>

<h3>Sample input</h3>
<code>2Ad<br>
12c<br>
2Ac<br>
2Bc<br>
1cd<br>
1xZ<br>
1dx<br>
BdZ</code>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<code>12ABcdxZ<br>
12BAcdxZ</code>

<h2>Submit &amp; test your code</h2>
<p>To test and submit code we provide a set of tools to help you. Download
<a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/tools">contest tools</a> if you don't have done that already. Then with
the challenge token you will be able to test and submit your solution to this
challenge.</p>
<code>Challenge token: CHALLENGE_7</code>
<br>
<h3>To test your program</h3>
<code>./test_challenge CHALLENGE_7 path/program</code>
<p>A nice output will tell you if your program got the right solution or not. You can try as
many times as you need.</p>
<h3>To submit your program to the challenge</h3>
<code>./submit_challenge CHALLENGE_7 path/source_pkg.tgz path/program</code>
<p>Note that you first need to solve the test phase before submiting the code. On the submit phase we
could give your program harder questions, so try to make your program failsafe.</p>
<p>Remind <b>you can only submit once!</b>. Once your solution is submitted you won't be able to amend it to fix issues or make it faster,
so please be sure your program is finished before submitting it.</p>

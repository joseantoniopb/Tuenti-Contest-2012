<p>Everybody loves to go karting with friends. We are opening our very own <strong>Tuenti Karting Circuit</strong> and we need you to use your programming skills and help us figure out how much gasoline we must buy each day. </p>

<p>We have exactly k karts and a few groups of people using the circuit all day. We need to buy 1 liter of gasoline per kart used per race. 
</p><ol>
<li>Before a race starts, groups are being seated one at a time until there are no more groups waiting or there are not enough karts for the next group. </li>
<li>Then the race starts, whether all the karts are being used or not.</li>
<li>When the race finishes they wait again in the same order until the day is over. </li>
</ol>
Every day we have exactly R races.

<p></p>
<p>For example, imagine that we have k=6 and R=3, and there are five groups of people with sizes: 1, 2, 4, 3, 1. The first time the race goes, the first two groups [1, 2] will ride, leaving three empty karts (the group of 4 should wait, and the group of 3 cannot go ahead of them). Then they will go to the back of the line, which is now 4, 3, 1, 1, 2. The second time, the circuit will hold 4 people: [4], leaving 2 empty karts. Now the line is 3, 1, 1, 2, 4. The third time, it will hold 5 people: [3, 1, 1]. Since we need exactly one liter for each kart's ride, it is 12 liters of gasoline.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line gives the number of test cases N. Each test case has two lines. The first line contains three integers R, k and G. G is the number of groups. The second line is the list of sizes of the groups, so this list has exactly G integers.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The number of liters of gasoline for each test case</p>

<h3>Sample input</h3>
<code>
2<br>
3 6 5<br>
1 2 4 3 1<br>
100 10 1<br>
1
</code>

<h3>Sample output</h3>
<code>
12<br>
100
</code>

<h2>Submit &amp; test your code</h2>
<p>To test and submit code we provide a set of tools to help you. Download
<a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/tools">contest tools</a> if you don't have done that already. Then with
the challenge token you will be able to test and submit your solution to this
challenge.</p>
<code>Challenge token: CHALLENGE_4</code>
<br>
<h3>To test your program</h3>
<code>./test_challenge CHALLENGE_4 path/program</code>
<p>A nice output will tell you if your program got the right solution or not. You can try as
many times as you need.</p>
<h3>To submit your program to the challenge</h3>
<code>./submit_challenge CHALLENGE_4 path/source_pkg.tgz path/program</code>
<p>Note that you first need to solve the test phase before submiting the code. On the submit phase we
could give your program harder questions, so try to make your program failsafe.</p>
<p>Remind <b>you can only submit once!</b>. Once your solution is submitted you won't be able to amend it to fix issues or make it faster,
so please be sure your program is finished before submitting it.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts, please check the <a href="https://contest.tuenti.net/Info/help">help section</a>.</p>

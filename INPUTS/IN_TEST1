One a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm
Two a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law
Three a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws
The conflict between the various rules is ironed out by the different positronic potentials in the brain
Well say that a robot is walking into danger and knows it The automatic potential that Rule 3 sets up turns him back
But suppose you order him to walk into that danger
In that case Rule 2 sets up a counterpotential higher than the previous one and the robot follows orders at the risk of existence
